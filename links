    previously iwas using jakarta but swagger was not working  .
    after research i came to know that swaggers  work with older version  of spring boot .
    so i reduced to older version of 2.7.11 .
    but then jakarta was not working .
    in obder to work with older we have to use javax api .
    javax copyright is managed by oracle upto java8  after that writes  were given to eclipses  and they remain it to jakarta .
    and  changed the version to 2.7.11 spring and java to 17.
